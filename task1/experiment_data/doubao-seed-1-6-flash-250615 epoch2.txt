To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the sequence of transformations and the positions of the blue marks. 

### Step 1: Initial State
The first image is a full gray square.

### Step 2: Vertical Fold
The second image shows a vertical split with a dashed rectangle on the left and a solid gray on the right.

### Step 3: Horizontal Fold
The third image shows a horizontal split with a dashed rectangle on the top and a solid gray on the bottom.

### Step 4: Final Fold with Blue Mark
The fourth image continues the horizontal split with a blue mark at the bottom.

### Analyzing Blue Mark Positions
We track the position of the blue marks through each fold. The final missing piece must align with the pattern of blue marks from the sequence. 

### Evaluating Options
By comparing the blue mark positions in each option, option **B** matches the pattern of blue marks as determined by the folding sequence.
