### Step 1: Analyze the sequence of changes  
- **Step 1**: A full gray circle.  
- **Step 2**: Circle divided into half gray and half white.  
- **Step 3**: Gray half contains specific blue shapes (cloud-like and square).  


### Step 2: Identify the pattern for the white half  
The pattern involves the blue shapes appearing in the gray half, and the next step should mirror the blue shapes in the white half. The blue shapes in the gray half (cloud-like and square) must be replicated in the white half.  


### Step 3: Evaluate the options  
- **Option D**: The white part contains the exact cloud-like shape and square as seen in the gray half of the previous step, matching the pattern.

### Step 1: Observe the initial hexagon and subsequent folds
We start with a hexagon and follow the folding steps, noting the changes in the position of the shaded area and dots.

### Step 2: Track dot positions through transformations
By examining the sequence, we focus on the final dot positions after the last fold. We compare the dot positions in each option to the expected final state.

### Step 3: Identify the correct option
Option D matches the dot positions and the final folded state as observed in the transformation sequence.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the sequence of transformations and the pattern of the blue element:

### Step 1: Identify the transformation sequence
- The initial image is a hexagon.
- Subsequent images show folding and reduction of shaded parts, ending with a specific triangular shape.
- The task is to find the hexagon that corresponds to the reverse of the folding process, focusing on the position and shape of the blue element.

### Step 2: Analyze the blue element
- By tracking the transformations, we observe that the blue element in the correct option matches the pattern resulting from unfolding the final triangular shape back to a hexagon.

### Conclusion
The option that best fills the missing piece is **B**.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the sequence of transformations and track the positions of the blue elements. 

### Step 1: Identify key elements
Observe the positions of the blue squares and dots through each step of the sequence. 

### Step 2: Match the pattern
The final step before the question mark shows specific positions of blue squares and dots. By comparing with the options, we identify that option **D** matches the pattern of blue squares in the top right and top left, and blue dots at the bottom, which aligns with the sequence of transformations.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the sequence of transformations in the paper fold puzzle. We track the changes in the shapes and positions of elements through each step. 

### Step 1: Observe the initial sequence of shapes and their transformations.
- The first few steps show a progression from a solid square to divided sections, then to a triangle, and finally to a triangle with a small blue dot.
- We need to identify the pattern of the blue elements and their positions.

### Step 2: Match the pattern to the options.
- By analyzing the progression, the final shape and position of the blue elements correspond to option **B**.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the sequence of paper folds and match the resulting shape pattern to the options. 

### Step 1: Identify the transformation pattern
We observe the progression of folds in the top sequence, noting the arrangement of shapes (circles, squares, hexagons). 

### Step 2: Match with options
We compare the shape arrangement in each option to the pattern derived from the fold sequence. Option B aligns best with the pattern of shapes and their positions after the final fold.
