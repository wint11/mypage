To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the sequence of folds and the placement of blue squares. 

### Step 1: Trace the folding process
- The initial image undergoes a series of folds, reducing the area and positioning the blue squares in specific folded regions.
- Each fold reveals the blue squares in a pattern that can be tracked through the sequence.

### Step 2: Identify the final pattern
- By examining the folding sequence, we focus on the arrangement of blue squares after the last fold. The key is to match the final revealed pattern with the options provided.

### Step 3: Match with options
- Analyzing the positions and arrangement of blue squares, option **B** best matches the pattern revealed by the folding sequence.

Answer: B
