To determine the correct answer, we analyze the sequence of transformations step by step. We observe the progression of shapes, colors, and positions through each step. By identifying the pattern of element addition and arrangement, we match the final required configuration to the given options. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Transformation**: The sequence starts with a solid shape and progresses to dividing and marking sections.
2. **Element Progression**: Each step introduces specific shapes (circles, squares) and their positions.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: By tracking the addition and placement of blue elements, we identify the configuration that follows the last visible step.

### Conclusion:
The option that best continues the pattern and matches the required configuration is **B**.

### Step 1: Observe the sequence of transformations
Each step modifies the previous image, introducing specific elements (dots, squares) in particular positions. 

### Step 2: Analyze the final pattern before the question mark
The last visible image has a diagonal shaded triangle and specific positions of blue dots and squares. 

### Step 3: Match with the options
We compare the options (A, B, C, D) to find the one that aligns with the pattern of elements in the final transformed state. Option **D** matches the positions of dots, squares, and other elements as per the sequence.

Answer: D

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the sequence of transformations step-by-step. We track the positions of key elements such as colored shapes and dots through each fold. 

### Step 1: Identify key elements in each step
- The initial steps involve dividing and shading parts of the square, then highlighting a triangle and a small blue square.
- We focus on the positions and types of elements (dots, squares) in the final visible step before the question mark.

### Step 2: Match with options
- By examining the positions and configurations of elements in the options, we determine that option **B** aligns with the pattern established by the sequence of folds. The elements (dots and squares) in option B match the positions and types seen in the preceding steps of the puzzle.
