To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the relationship between the patterns. The blue shapes represent hollowed-out parts, which are formed by folding. We need to identify the folding option that matches the symmetry and transformation of the blue shapes.

### Step 1: Identify Symmetry and Transformation
The top patterns show a progression of blue shapes formed by folding. We focus on the symmetry and the way the blue shapes align under folding. Option B features a circle with a diagonal split, where half is shaded. This aligns with the folding logic: when the paper is folded, the shaded (or blue) parts form a symmetric half under the fold.

### Step 2: Verify Consistency
Option B’s first circle is unshaded, and the second shows a diagonal fold with half shaded, which matches the pattern of blue shapes forming through symmetric folding.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the relationship between the original square patterns with blue cutouts and the folding options. 

### Step 1: Identify the folding logic
The blue shapes represent hollowed-out parts. When a square is folded, the hollowed parts on one side should align with the corresponding parts on the other side. We need to find the folding option where the hollowed parts match the pattern in the top sequences.

### Step 2: Evaluate option B
Option B shows an original square on the left and a folded square on the right with a diagonal shaded triangle. Folding a square along its diagonal causes the hollowed parts to align symmetrically along the diagonal, which matches the pattern of blue cutouts in the top sequences. 

Thus, the option that best matches the patterns is **B**.

- **Option B**: The first circle is whole, and the second shows a circle split vertically with half shaded. This aligns with the pattern where folding a circle and cutting out half would result in the observed hollowed regions.
- **Option C**: The transformation does not match the pattern of hollowed areas.
- **Option D**: The transformation does not match the pattern of hollowed areas.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze how the blue cut-outs in the top patterns are formed. The key is to identify which folding rule, when applied to a full circle, produces the observed blue shapes.

### Step 1: Evaluate Option B
- The left side of Option B shows a full circle.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the sequence of hexagons with blue cut-outs. The key is to identify which folding option reproduces the pattern of adding blue shapes through folding.

### Step 1: Analyze the sequence
The top row shows a hexagon with a small blue shape, followed by hexagons with increasingly more blue cut-outs. We need to find the folding rule that matches this progression.

### Step 2: Evaluate each option
- **Option A**: The transformation shows a half-section, which does not match the pattern of adding multiple blue cut-outs.
- **Option B**: The transformation of the hexagon results in multiple indentations, aligning with the sequence of adding blue shapes in the top row.
- **Option C**: The transformation shows a simple split, which does not match the pattern of multiple blue cut-outs.
- **Option D**: The transformation shows a different type of deformation, not matching the sequence of adding blue cut-outs.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the transformation of the blue shapes across the top patterns. We need to identify which option's folding pattern matches how the blue shapes are arranged and transformed through the given sequences.

### Step 1: Identify the transformation pattern
The top patterns show a sequence of blue shapes that can be explained by a folding rule. We focus on option C, where the right side depicts a diamond-shaped arrangement, which aligns with the way the blue shapes in the top patterns are folded and positioned.

### Step 2: Verify alignment
Option C's folding rule correctly matches the transformation of the blue shapes from the initial pattern to the subsequent patterns, as the diamond shape formed by folding corresponds to the arrangement of the blue shapes in the given sequences.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the relationship between the blank square (left) and the square with blue shapes (right) in each option.

### Step 1: Identify the pattern matching
We need to find the option where folding the blank square results in the blue shapes as seen in the top patterns.

### Step 2: Evaluate each option
- **Option A**: The right side has a complex cross-shaped shaded area, which does not match the simple corner blue shapes in the top patterns.
- **Option B**: The right side has a small shaded triangle in the corner, which aligns with the corner placement of blue shapes in the top patterns.
- **Option C**: The right side has a different shaded configuration than the corner blue shapes in the top patterns.
- **Option D**: The right side has a large shaded triangle, which does not match the corner blue shapes in the top patterns.
