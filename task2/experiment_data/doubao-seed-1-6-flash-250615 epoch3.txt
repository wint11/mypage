To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the relationship between the initial circle and the patterns with blue shapes. The blue shapes represent hollowed-out parts, and the folding rule should align the hollowed parts with the shaded region in the transformed circle.

### Step 1: Observe the blue shapes' positions
- The fourth pattern in the top row has a blue spot at the bottom. 
- Option C shows an initial circle transforming into a circle with the lower half shaded, which matches the position of the blue spot at the bottom.

### Step 2: Verify consistency
Other options (A, B, D) do not align with the position of the blue shape in the fourth pattern. Option C’s lower half shading corresponds to the blue spot’s position in the fourth top pattern, confirming it as the correct folding rule.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the transformation from the plain circle to the circles with blue cutouts. 

### Step 1: Identify the transformation pattern
The top patterns show a plain circle transforming into circles with blue cutouts. We need to find the folding rule that explains this transformation.

### Step 2: Evaluate each option
- **Option A**: The right figure has a small shaded segment, which does not match the pattern of larger cutouts seen in the top patterns.  
- **Option B**: The right figure shows a circle split into two halves, with one half dashed (unfolded) and the other shaded (folded). This matches the pattern where folding a circle creates the shaded/folded region corresponding to the blue cutouts in the top patterns.  
- **Option C**: The right figure has a small shaded segment, similar to Option A, which does not align with the larger cutout pattern.  
- **Option D**: The right figure’s shading does not match the folding pattern required to produce the blue cutouts seen in the top patterns.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the transformation of the blue shapes across the patterns. The key is to identify how the blue (hollowed) parts align under the folding operation. 

### Step 1: Identify the folding pattern
We observe that the transformation involves folding the circle such that half of it is a different shade. Option C shows a full circle on the left and a circle split into two equal halves (half gray) on the right. This matches the folding rule where the circle is folded to reveal a half-gray, half-white configuration, which aligns with the pattern of hollowed blue shapes being folded to fit this symmetry.

### Step 2: Evaluate each option
- **Option A**: The folding steps do not match the progression of blue shapes seen in the top patterns.  
- **Option B**: The angle and shape of the shaded parts do not align with the pattern progression.  
- **Option C**: The first image is a full circle. The second image shows a half-circle with a shaded portion, and the third image shows a quarter-circle with shaded parts, which matches the progression of the blue shapes in the top patterns.  
- **Option D**: The folding steps and shaded areas do not correspond to the pattern progression.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the transformation from a full circle to the final shape with hollowed blue regions. 

### Step 1: Identify the initial and transformed states
The top patterns show the result of folding a circle and cutting out blue shapes. We need to match this with the folding sequences in options A, B, C, D.

### Step 2: Evaluate option B

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze how the blue hollowed shapes are formed through folding. 

### Step 1: Identify the folding process
We need to find a sequence where folding a circle produces the observed blue hollowed shapes. Let's evaluate each option:

- **Option A**: The sequence involves quartering the circle, which does not match the complexity of the top patterns' blue shapes.  
- **Option B**: The first image is a full circle. The second image shows a circle divided into two halves (white and gray). The third image aligns with the folding process that creates the observed blue hollowed shapes. This matches the pattern of cutting out the gray (hollowed) parts through folding.  
- **Option C**: The sequence does not align with the formation of the blue shapes seen in the top patterns.  
- **Option D**: The sequence involves diagonal division, which does not correspond to the observed blue shapes.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the transformation from the initial full circle to the subsequent patterns. 

### Step 1: Identify folding stages
The top patterns show a progression starting from a full circle. The key is to find the folding sequence that matches the hollowed (blue) shapes. 

### Step 2: Evaluate option D

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the transformation of the blue (hollow) shapes through the patterns. 

### Step 1: Identify the initial and transformed patterns
The top row shows a sequence where the original shape is transformed to have blue shapes in specific positions. We need to find the folding rule that matches this transformation.

### Step 2: Evaluate each option
- **Option A**: The transformation involves triangles, which does not match the linear split and gray sections observed.  
- **Option B**: The first step is a square. The second step splits the square vertically into gray and white sections. The third step matches the position of the gray section corresponding to the hollowed parts in the top patterns.  
- **Option C**: The transformation involves a vertical split in the opposite direction, which does not align with the observed positions.  
- **Option D**: The transformation involves multiple sections, which does not match the simpler vertical split observed.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the progression of blue shapes in the top sequence. Each panel shows a reduction in the number of blue shapes, indicating that the blue shapes are being folded out of view.

### Step 1: Observe the sequence
The top sequence starts with multiple blue shapes and progresses to fewer shapes, ending with a small blue shape. We need a folding rule that explains this reduction.

### Step 2: Evaluate each option
- **Option A**: The right side shows a large triangle, which does not match the gradual reduction seen in the sequence.
- **Option B**: The right side shows horizontal bands, which does not align with the pattern of reducing blue shapes.
- **Option C**: The right side shows a cross pattern, which is not consistent with the observed reduction of blue shapes.
- **Option D**: The right side shows a triangle with a dotted line, which matches the pattern of folding the blue shapes out of view, as the triangle would cover the blue shapes when folded, resulting in the observed reduction.
