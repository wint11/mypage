To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the transformation of the blue shapes across the patterns. The key is to identify how the blue shapes (representing hollowed-out areas) move from the initial positions to the final central position, which corresponds to a diagonal fold. 

### Step 1: Identify the folding direction

### Step 2: Evaluate each option
- **Option A**: The transformation does not align with the diagonal fold required to move corner shapes to the center.  
- **Option B**: The left square is folded along a diagonal, resulting in a gray triangle that matches the movement of shapes from corners to the center.  
- **Option C**: The transformation is not a diagonal fold and does not match the movement of shapes.  
- **Option D**: The transformation does not align with the diagonal fold required to move corner shapes to the center.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the sequence of patterns at the top and match it to the options A-D.

### Step 1: Observe the sequence of patterns
The top row shows a progression of shapes resulting from a folding process. We need to identify which folding rule (A-D) produces the observed transformation.

### Step 2: Analyze each option
- **Option A**: Shows a square transforming into a triangle with a single shaded part. This does not match the sequence of shapes in the top row.
- **Option B**: Shows a square with a shaded part and another shape. This does not align with the progression of shapes in the top row.
- **Option C**: Shows a square with horizontal shaded parts. This does not match the sequence of shapes observed.
- **Option D**: Shows a square being folded to form a diamond-shaped pattern with shaded parts, which matches the progression of shapes in the top row.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the transformation of blue shapes across the given patterns. We need to identify the folding action that aligns the blue shapes' positions consistently.

### Step 1: Identify transformation pattern
Observe the positions of blue shapes in consecutive patterns. The folding rule should reflect or align the blue shapes such that each subsequent pattern is a result of folding the previous one.

### Step 2: Evaluate option B
Option B shows a square with a split where one part is white and the other is gray. This matches the transformation pattern of the blue shapes across the given sequences, as the folding action aligns the blue shapes' positions appropriately.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the transformation from the initial square to the subsequent patterns.

### Step 1: Identify the folding pattern
We need to find which option shows the correct transformation when the square is folded. Option A depicts a square on the left transforming into a diamond shape on the right. This diamond shape is consistent with folding the square along its diagonals, which creates a symmetric diamond pattern.

### Step 2: Verify against the sequence
The top patterns follow a folding rule that results in symmetric shapes. Folding the square along its diagonals matches the transition from the initial square to the diamond shape shown in option A.
