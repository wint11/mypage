To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the relationship between the original circles (with blue hollowing-out shapes) and the folded/shaded versions. Key observations:  
1. Paper folding typically uses straight diameters (vertical/horizontal) for simple folds.  
2. The shaded region in the folded version corresponds to the area not occupied by the blue shapes before folding.  

For the top - row circles:  
- Circles with blue shapes on opposite sides (e.g., two dots on top edges, hexagons/square on top/bottom) suggest a **vertical fold** (dividing the circle into left/right halves) or **horizontal fold** (dividing into top/bottom halves).  
- Comparing options, **Option B** shows a vertical fold creating a half - shaded circle. This matches because the blue shapes’ positions in the original circles align with the shaded half’s position after a vertical fold through the circle’s center. Other options (A: horizontal split, C: curved non - fold split, D: diagonal split) do not match the symmetric pattern of the original circles’ blue shape distribution. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|>.

To solve this paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original circular patterns and their folded versions, focusing on how the blue hollowing-out shapes transform under folding. Each option represents a potential folding rule, and we need to identify which matches the transformation of the blue shapes across the top row’s patterns.  

- **Option A**: Shows a curved cutout, but lacks alignment with the specific positioning of hollowed shapes seen in the top row.  
- **Option B**: Features a half - shaded circular division with an irregular edge, inconsistent with the curved edges implied by circular folding.  
- **Option C**: Displays a small curved cutout near the top edge, matching the style of transformations seen in the top row’s patterns (where hollowed shapes align with such curved edges after folding).  
- **Option D**: Presents a straight - edged half - and - half division, which does not match the curved edges associated with circular folding shown in the top row.  


Thus, the option that best matches the folding rule is <|begin_of_box|>C<|end_of_box|>.

To solve this paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original circle (unfolded state) and the folded semicircle (folded state) for each option, considering how blue hollowed - out shapes transform under the fold.  

1. **Understand the Fold Rule**: The goal is to identify which folding direction (vertical, horizontal, diagonal) and shading pattern matches the sequence of patterns above. Each pattern’s blue shapes (hollowing out) must reflect consistently when folded.  
2. **Analyze Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Shows a vertical fold, creating a semicircle with a vertical division. This doesn’t match the non - vertical/horizontal divisions seen in the top patterns.  
   - **Option B**: Has a diagonal fold, which isn’t consistent with the symmetric arrangements of blue shapes in the top patterns.  
   - **Option C**: Features a horizontal fold, dividing the circle into an upper gray half and a lower white half. This matches the idea of folding along a horizontal diameter, where the upper portion of the original circle becomes the visible part of the semicircle, reflecting the hollowed - out shapes’ symmetry.  
   - **Option D**: Shows an overlapping fold, which introduces complex overlaps not observed in the top patterns.  
3. **Consistency Check**: Since all top patterns involve symmetric arrangements of blue shapes around the circle, a horizontal fold (as in Option C) ensures that the hollowed - out regions’ reflections align with the semicircular shape’s structure. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>C<|end_of_box|>.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the unfolded circle and its folded version, focusing on how blue (hollowed-out) shapes transform. We evaluate each folding rule (A–D) by checking how the position and connection of blue shapes in the unfolded circle match the folded result.  

- **Option A**: Shows a half - moon with a shaded semicircle, but the connection of hollowed areas doesn’t match typical fold patterns.  
- **Option B**: Has a horizontal fold resulting in a top - half shaded semicircle. However, the hollowed - out shapes’ distribution in the top row doesn’t align with a purely horizontal fold’s expected symmetry.  
- **Option C**: Displays a quarter - shaped shaded area, which doesn’t match the varied positions of hollowed shapes in the top row.  
- **Option D**: Features a large semicircular shaded area that matches how hollowed - out shapes connect when folded along a diameter, consistent with the arrangement of blue shapes in the top row.  

Thus, the best match is <|begin_of_box|>D<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze how the hollowed-out (blue) shapes transform when folded. The key is that folding mirrors these hollows across the fold line, so the final shape’s hollows must reflect the original’s positions symmetrically.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original circles with blue hollow shapes and the folded results. The key is identifying the consistent folding rule (direction and effect) across all patterns.  

1. **Understand the Hollowing Rule**: Blue shapes represent “hollowed” areas; the shaded area in the folded state is the remaining part after folding, with the hollows overlapping.  
2. **Analyze Folding Direction**: For the original circles with blue shapes positioned near the edges (e.g., left/right sides), a horizontal fold along the circle’s diameter makes sense. When folded horizontally, the top half covers the bottom half, resulting in a semicircular shaded area for the bottom half.  
3. **Match with Options**: Option <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|> shows a full circle folding into a semicircle with the lower half shaded, which aligns with the logic of a horizontal fold covering the top half (leaving the bottom semicircle as the visible shaded area).

To solve this paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original circles with blue (hollowed-out) shapes and the folded versions, ensuring consistency across all patterns under a single folding rule.  

Each original circle contains blue shapes representing hollowed areas. When folded, the **non - hollowed (shaded) area** in the folded circle corresponds to the area complementary to the blue shapes in the original circle. We evaluate each folding rule (A, B, C, D) based on how well the folded shape’s geometry matches the expected mapping of the original shapes’ positions.  

- **Option A**: Shows a straight - line fold resulting in a perfectly bisected semicircle, but the shape doesn’t match the irregular distribution of blue shapes in the original images.  
- **Option B**: Has a curved boundary in the folded semicircle, which doesn’t align with the typical folding symmetry needed for consistent hollowed - out patterns.  
- **Option C**: Features a semicircle with a curved edge that can accommodate the varied positions of blue shapes in the original circles, matching the expected folding symmetry and shape of the non - hollowed area.  
- **Option D**: Has an irregularly shaped shaded area that fails to maintain the logical correspondence between original and folded shapes.

2. **Analyze Shape Distribution**: Original circles have blue shapes scattered; after folding, these shapes should align on one side of the fold, forming a semicircle with distinct colored regions.  
3. **Evaluate Options**:

To solve the folding puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original circle with blue shapes and the folded result, ensuring consistency across all patterns. Each pattern uses the same folding rule, so we identify which option’s fold and shading match the transformation of blue shapes. Among options A, B, C, D, option B correctly represents the folding action (a diagonal fold creating a half - shaded circle) that aligns with the pattern of blue shape transformation.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the folding rule by examining the relationship between the original (unfolded) and folded states, focusing on how blue shapes (representing hollowing out) transform under the fold. The goal is to identify which option’s folding action matches the consistent transformation across the top row’s patterns.  

By evaluating each option (A–D), we observe that the folding rule likely involves a specific geometric transformation (e.g., diagonal or radial fold) where the shaded area in the folded state corresponds to the position of blue shapes. Among the options, **option <|begin_of_box|>D<|end_of_box|>** best matches the expected folding behavior, as its shaded triangular area aligns with the logical transformation of blue shapes under the stated folding rule.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original circles with blue (hollowed-out) shapes and the folded half - circles. The goal is to find which folding rule (A, B, C, D) applies consistently.  

1. Understand the folding logic: When folding a circle, the non - blue area (which remains visible after folding) corresponds to the shaded region in the folded half - circle.  
2. Analyze each option’s fold direction:  
   - **Option A**: Horizontal fold divides the circle into upper/lower halves. The original circles’ blue shapes aren’t aligned with a horizontal division, so it doesn’t match.  
   - **Option B**: Diagonal fold (from top - right to bottom - left) creates an irregular division, which doesn’t align with the uniformity of the original circles’ blue shapes.  
   - **Option C**: The shaded area is a partial semicircle, inconsistent with the expected full half - circle shading.  
   - **Option D**: Vertical fold along a diameter divides the circle into left/right halves. When the left half (with blue shapes) is folded over, the right half (without blue) becomes the visible shaded region, matching the structure of all original circles’ blue shape positions relative to a vertical fold.  

Thus, the best - matching folding rule is <|begin_of_box|>D<|end_of_box|>.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original circles with blue shapes (representing hollowed-out areas) andthe resulting half - circles under different folding rules. The goal is to identify which folding rule (A, B, C, D) consistently explains how the hollowed - out areas translate into the shaded regions in the half - circles.  

1. Understand the folding logic: When folding a full circle into a half - circle, the fold acts as a diameter, dividing the circle into two congruent semicircles. The position of the hollowed - out (blue) shapes in the original circle determines the unshaded region in the half - circle, while the remaining area is shaded.  
2. Analyze each option:  
   - **Option A**: Features a curved division, inconsistent with standard linear folding (diameters are straight lines).  
   - **Option B**: Has a diagonal division from top - left to bottom - right; the shading does not align with typical hollow - out translations.  
   - **Option C**: Uses a horizontal division, implying a top - bottom fold, but the shading doesn’t match the hollow - out patterns.  
   - **Option D**: Uses a diagonal fold from top - right to bottom - left. This fold direction allows the hollowed - out areas’ positions to map correctly to the shaded region’s location in the half - circle, consistent across the sequence of original circles.  

Thus, the option that best matches the folding rule is <|begin_of_box|>D<|end_of_box|>.

To solve this paper fold puzzle, we analyze the folding rule by examining how blue hollow-out shapes transform across the sequence and match the given options (A–D). Key steps include identifying the consistent folding mechanism and how blue shapes’ positions relate to the folded structure.  

1. **Understand the Folding Mechanism**: The puzzle requires determining which folding rule (A–D) consistently maps the blue hollow-out shapes from the flat hexagon to its folded form. Blue shapes represent areas “hollowed out” (cut out), so their position in the folded shape depends on the fold’s symmetry.  
2. **Analyze Shape Transformation**: Examine each option’s folded shape (second image in boxes A–D) against the pattern of blue shapes in the top row. The blue shapes are distributed across different edges/corners of the hexagon. A valid folding rule must produce a folded shape where these positions align with the hollowed regions.

   - **A**: Shows a triangular hollow, inconsistent with the scattered blue shapes.  
   - **B**: Shows layered hollows, not matching the single-sided hollow pattern.  
   - **C**: Shows horizontal division, not matching the multi-edge distribution of blue shapes.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, analyze the pattern of shapes and folding logic:  

1. Observe the top row’s hexagons with blue shapes (hollows) and identify the folding rule: the final folded shape must reflect the arrangement of internal shapes after folding.  
2. Examine each option (A–D) for consistency with the folding logic. The original hexagons’ internal shapes transform into a folded configuration where the shape’s structure (e.g., diagonal fold creating a triangular flap) matches the progression of the top row.  
3. Option <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|> shows a clear diagonal fold resulting in a large shaded triangular flap, which aligns with the transformation of the original hexagon’s internal shapes into a structured folded form. Other options (B, C, D) either lack the pronounced structural change or misrepresent the shape arrangement.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original figures’ blue hollowing-out shapes and their folded counterparts, ensuring the folding rule applies consistently to all patterns.  

1. **Understand the Folding Rule**: The blue shapes represent hollowing out; when folded, their position in the original figure maps to a corresponding position in the folded figure based on the fold’s axis.  
2. **Analyze Original Figures**: The top row has houses with blue shapes (circles, hexagons, squares) in various positions (roof, edges, corners). These shapes must align correctly under a single fold.  
3. **Evaluate Options A–D**:  
   - **Option A**: Shows a fold creating a triangular hollow on the top - right of the house. This matches the idea of folding the top section (where many original blue shapes are located) downward, causing the shapes to align with the new top - right position.

1. **Understand the Top Row Patterns**: The four top images show houses with blue shapes (hollowing-outs) in different positions (corner, middle, etc.). When folded, these shapes must map consistently to one of the folding rules (A–D).  
2. **Analyze Folding Options (A–D)**:

   - **Option A**: Shows a vertical fold resulting in a half - shaded (gray) and half - unshaded (white) shape. This matches the idea that hollowed - out areas (on one side of the original) appear on one side of the folded shape.  
   - **Options B, C, D** do not match the expected pattern of hollowed - out shapes mapping consistently due to their non - standard fold directions (e.g., small corner fold in B, horizontal band in C, slanted area in D).  
3. Confirm consistency: All top - row houses use the same folding rule, and Option A’s vertical fold correctly maps the hollowed - out shapes’ positions after folding. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the relationship between the blue hollow shapes in the top sequence and the resulting cut - out in the folded shape. The blue shapes represent hollowing out, so when the flat shape is folded, the position of these shapes determines the location of the cut - out in the 3D structure. Examine each option:  
- **Option A**: Shows a vertical fold, where the left portion of the flat shape folds over to the right. This matches the pattern of blue shapes shifting toward the right side in the top sequence, resulting in a right - side cut - out in the folded shape.  
- **Option B** has a horizontal cut - out, which does not align with the vertical/horizontal shifts of the blue shapes.  
- **Option C** has a diagonal cut - out, which does not match the consistent directional shifts of the blue shapes seen in the top sequence.  
- **Option D** has a small corner cut - out, which cannot accommodate the size and position variation of the blue shapes.  

Thus, the folding rule that best matches the patterns is Option <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

The key is identifying how blue shapes (hollowing out) transform during folding, as the gray areas in the folded shape correspond to the original positions of blue shapes. By examining the distribution and arrangement of blue shapes in the top images, we determine the most consistent folding rule. Among options A–D, option <|begin_of_box|>D<|end_of_box|> best matches the transformation logic of the top patterns.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original shapes (top row) and the folding rules (A–D). Key steps:  
1. Recognize that blue shapes represent hollowing out, and the folding rule must apply uniformly to all top images.  
2. Evaluate each option’s folded shape:  
   - **A** splits into three sections, which doesn’t match uniformity.  
   - **B** shows a vertical fold splitting the shape into left (white, no cut-out) and right (gray, cut-out) sections. This aligns with how cut-outs on the right of original shapes would combine after a vertical fold, matching the arrangement of shapes.  
   - **C** uses a horizontal fold, which isn’t consistent with the mixed orientation of shapes in the top images.  
   - **D** creates a triangular shape, which doesn’t match the rectangular structure of the original and folded shapes.  

Thus, the folding rule that matches all patterns is <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|>.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original shape and the folded result, focusing on how the blue cutout shapes transform. Each top - row image shows a gray rectangle with blue cutouts; the folding rule must consistently explain their appearance in the folded state. By examining the options, we determine that the folding creates a half - rectangle where the cutout’s position reflects the original’s position relative to the fold axis. Among options A, B, C, D, option <|begin_of_box|>C<|end_of_box|> best matches the pattern of how cutouts transform during folding.

To solve the folding puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original rectangular shape and its folded form, considering the position and arrangement of the blue hollowed - out shapes. The key is identifying a consistent folding rule across the top sequence.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the folding rules and how the blue shapes transform across the sequence. The key is identifying which folding option (A, B, C, D) matches the consistent transformation of shapes when the gray rectangle is folded.  

1. **Understand the Folding Rule**: Blue shapes represent “hollowing out” and must align consistently after folding. The goal is to find a fold that mirrors or combines the shapes’ positions as seen in the top row’s transformations.  
2. **Analyze Options**:  
   - **A** (vertical fold into three sections): Does not match the compact grouping of shapes.  
   - **B** (diagonal fold forming a large triangle): Overlaps too much, not matching the varied shape arrangements.  
   - **C** (diagonal fold forming a medium-sized triangle): Does not align with the uniformity needed for multiple shapes.  
   - **D** (horizontal fold into two sections): Creates a simple division that allows shapes to align as observed in the top row’s transformations.  

After evaluating, the folding rule that best matches the pattern is represented by option <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|> (note: rechecking logic—wait, earlier thought may have error; actually, the correct analysis shows diagonal fold (B) as the standard for such puzzles with multiple shapes, as folding along a diagonal groups shapes into a cohesive area).

The top row shows a gray rectangle with blue cut - outs changing position and quantity (from 1 → 2, shifting from corner/side to center/upper areas). The folding rule must replicate this: creating paired cut - outs through consistent folding.  

- **Option A** results in stacked rectangular layers, which does not match the varied positions of cut - outs.  
- **Option B** produces a large triangle with a smaller inner triangle, which doesn’t align with the distinct positioning of multiple cut - outs seen in the top row.

1. Observe the top row: Blue shapes are initially positioned on edges (sides/top/bottom) of the gray rectangle.  
2. Analyze folding options:  
   - **A** suggests a horizontal/vertical split, which doesn’t match edge-to-corner transformation.  
   - **B** uses a diagonal fold but results in a triangular shape orientation inconsistent with edge-to-center folding.  
   - **C** implies horizontal layering, which doesn’t align with edge shapes becoming a single triangular cut-out.  
   - **D** shows a diagonal fold that transforms the entire edge area into a large triangular hollowed shape, matching how multiple edge blue shapes combine into a unified triangular form during folding.  

Thus, the option that best matches the folding rule is <|begin_of_box|>D<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the relationship between the original and folded states for each option, considering the blue hollowing - out shapes. The top patterns involve various blue shapes (squares, hexagons, etc.) whose positions change upon folding. Option C shows a large triangular cut - out after folding, which aligns with how complex arrangements of hollowed - out shapes can transform into a unified triangular form when folded under a consistent rule (like a diagonal fold). Other options (A, B, D) do not match the transformation of diverse hollowed - out shapes into a single coherent polygonal cut - out as seen in the top patterns. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>C<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze how the original square’s features (blue hollows) transform under folding. The top row shows squares with blue shapes (cut-outs) in various positions; the folding rule must apply consistently.  

- **Option A** shows a square folded into a large triangle, matching the logical transformation of corner/edge blue shapes (which align to form a triangular shaded area when folded along a diagonal).  
- Options B, C, D show non - triangular or non - diagonal folds, which don’t matchthe consistent positional mapping of the top row’s shapes.  

Thus, the best match is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct foldingrule, analyze how the blue hollow shapes transform across the sequence. The first image has four corner squares, the second has two central squares, the third has one central circle, and the fourth returns to four shapes—all consistent with a diagonal fold. When folding a square along its main diagonal (as in Option A), the corner shapes align along the edges of the resulting triangle, matching the reduction and repositioning seen in subsequent images.

To solve this paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the initial shapes (with blue hollows/outlines) and the folding rules (A–D).

To solve this folding puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original patterns and the folding options (A–D), focusing on how blue hollow-out shapes transform under the same folding rule.  

1. **Understand the Folding Rule**: The blue shapes represent hollowed - out areas. When folded, these shapes’ positions and arrangements must match one of the options (A–D).  
2. **Evaluate Each Option**:  
   - **Option A**: Shows a diagonal fold with a triangular cutout. None of the top images have triangular hollows, so A is incorrect.  
   - **Option B**: Divides the square into three sections (one white, two grays). The top images do not show such a tripartite division, so B is incorrect.  
   - **Option C**: Creates horizontal layered sections. The top images’ shapes do not align with this horizontal layering, so C is incorrect.

To solve the folding puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original patterned squares (top row) and the folding rules (A–D). The blue shapes represent hollowing out, and the folding rule must consistently map these shapes to the folded result.  

1. Observe the top - row patterns: Each square has blue shapes (cuts) in distinct positions (e.g., corners, central areas). When folded, these cuts should align according to the chosen rule.  
2. Evaluate each option:  
   - **A**: Shows a division into three sections, which doesn’t match the expected alignment of cuts from the top - row patterns.  
   - **B**: Divides the paper into two equal vertical sections. The original cuts’ positions would logically combine into a single gray section in the folded state, matching the distribution of cuts seen in the top - row images.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the initial blue hollows (cut - outs) and their appearance after folding. The key is identifying which folding rule (A, B, C, D) correctly mirrors the position and shape of the cut - outs.  

1. Observe the top - row patterns: Blue shapes are in opposite corners (e.g., top - left and bottom - right) and become a single mirrored shape when folded.  
2. Examine folding rules:  
   - **Option A** shows a non - triangular division, not matching corner - based cut - out mirroring.  
   - **Option B** has a triangular gray area in the top - left corner, consistent with folding along a diagonal (top - left to bottom - right) where a cut - out in the bottom - right corner would appear as a triangle in the top - left area.  
   - **Option C** has a rectangular gray area, which doesn’t match the corner - based cut - out pattern.

To solve this folding puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original blue cutout positions and the resulting shaded areas in each option, considering the consistent folding rule.  

1. **Understand the Folding Rule**: The blue “hollowing out” shapes must map to the boundaries of the shaded area when the paper is folded. We examine how different fold types (diagonal, horizontal, vertical) affect the position of cutouts.  
2. **Analyze Original Patterns**: The top row’s blue cutouts are positioned near corners/edges; folding must create a symmetrical arrangement of these cutouts within the shaded area.  
3. **Evaluate Options**:  
   - **A** has a triangular shaded area but with a different orientation than expected.  
   - **B** uses a horizontal fold, which doesn’t match the asymmetry of most original cutout positions.  
   - **C** uses a vertical fold, which also fails to account for diagonal positioning of cutouts.  
   - **D** uses a diagonal fold (frombottom - left to top - right), which matches the symmetry needed to map corner/edge cutouts to the large triangular shaded area.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the transformation of the blue hollowed - out shapes under different folding rules. The key is to identify which folding method (A, B, C, or D) produces a gray area that corresponds to the transformed position of the hollowed - out regions.  

1. Examine the sequence of shapes: The initial shapes have blue hollowed - out regions in specific positions (e.g., corners). When folded, these regions’ positions change, and the remaining area becomes the gray region.  
2. Analyze each folding option:  
   - **Option A**: Shows a square folded along its main diagonal (from top - left to bottom - right). This creates a triangular gray area, which matches the expected transformation of corner - positioned hollowed - out regions.  
   - **Option B**: Uses a horizontal fold, resulting in a rectangular gray area on top, which does not match the triangular pattern seen in the sequence.  
   - **Option C**: Has a small corner folded, producing a tiny triangular gray area, inconsistent with the broader transformation shown.

To solve this folding puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the unfolded (left) and folded (right) states, focusing on how the blue hollow shapes’ positions transform under a consistent folding rule.  

1. **Identify the Folding Rule**: The key is determining which diagonal or axis fold maps the hollow shapes’ positions correctly. Observing the top row’s patterns, the blue hollow shapes occupy distinct quadrants/corners of the square. A diagonal fold (either from top - left to bottom - right or vice versa) is likely, as folding along a diagonal transforms the square into a triangle, with the hollow shapes’ positions reflecting across the fold line.  
2. **Match with Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Shows a square folded into a triangle with the gray (uncut) area as the upper - left triangle. This matches the logic that a hollow in the top - left of the original square would appear in the upper - left of the folded triangle after folding along the main diagonal (top - left to bottom - right).  
   - **Options B, C, D** do not align with the positional consistency of the hollow shapes across the top row. Option B has the gray area in the upper - right of the triangle, which doesn’t match the observed hollow positions; Option C uses a horizontal fold (not matching the square - to - triangle transformation); Option D uses a corner fold (also inconsistent with the hollow positions).

To solve this paper fold puzzle, we analyze the folding rule by matching the transformation of shapes across the top row and comparing with options A–D. The key is identifying which folding action (left panel → right panel) consistently reproduces the pattern of shape removal (blue = hollowed out) and remaining area.  

- **Option A** shows a full diagonal fold, resulting in a single large triangle. This matches the logical progression of removing blue shapes and folding to leave a triangular remnant.  
- Other options (B, C, D) show different folds (layered triangles, small corner triangles, or vertical rectangles) that do not align with the varied yet consistent shape transformations in the top row.  

Thus, the best match is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To solve this folding puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the initial blue shapes (hollowing out) and the folded results, ensuring consistency with a single folding rule across all patterns.  

1. **Understand the Folding Rule**: The goal is to identify which option (A–D) correctly models how blue shapes transform via folding. Key observations include the shape of the folded result, the presence of dashed lines (indicating fold boundaries), and alignment with typical geometric folds (e.g., diagonal, corner, etc.).  
2. **Analyze Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Shows a square with a dashed border on the folded triangle, implying the original square’s outline remains visible—this does not match the expected internal transformation of blue shapes.  
   - **Option B**: Depicts a square folded into a right triangle (consistent with a diagonal fold), with the gray area representing the transformed blue shape. This matches the logical outcome of folding a square along its diagonal, where the blue shapes’ positions align with the triangle’s structure.  
   - **Option C**: Has an irregularly shaped triangle with a bordered area, which does not match the uniformity of diagonal folding.  
   - **Option D**: Shows a small triangle in the corner, inconsistent with the larger, central transformation seen in the top images.  

3. **Consistency Check**: Since all top images involve blue shapes distributed across the square, a diagonal fold (as in Option B) ensures the blue shapes’ positions map logically to the right triangle’s structure, maintaining consistency across varying initial blue shapes. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|>.

To solve this folding puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original blue hollowed - out shapes (top row) and the folded results (options A - D). The key is identifying which folding rule creates a shape whose hollowed - out areas match the original patterns.  

1. Analyze each option’s folding logic and resulting shape:  
   - **Option A**: Folding along a diagonal and creating a triangular hollow creates a shape with angular symmetry, matching the scattered yet structured hollows in the top images.  
   - **Options B, C, D** fail to match the scattered hollow patterns (B’s large triangle within a frame, C’s vertical rectangles, D’s corner triangle do not align with the original shapes’ distribution).  

2. Confirm consistency across all top images: All top images show scattered blue shapes; only Option A’s folding produces a shape where the hollows reflect the original’s scattered yet symmetrical nature. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the sequence of folding (initial circle → first fold → second fold) and how the blue hollowed-out shapes map to the final form. The top row’s initial circles have blue shapes in quadrant positions, and the folding rule must consistently transform these into the final shapes. By examining each option’s intermediate (semicircle) and final (quarter-circle) stages, **Option C** correctly reflects the folding logic: first fold along a vertical diameter creating a semicircle with gray on one half, then fold along a horizontal diameter creating a quarter-circle with gray in the lower - right quadrant, matching the transformation of the hollowed - out regions.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the transformation sequence (original → half-folded → quarter-folded) across the top row patterns. The key is identifying consistent folding directions (e.g., vertical/horizontal) and how shapes align during folds.  

- **Toprow patterns**: Each circle undergoes two folds (first into a half, then into a quarter). The second image is a half with shapes aligned along a diameter, and the third image is a quarter with shapes in a quadrant.  
- **Evaluate options A–D**:  
  - *Option A*: Second image uses a diagonal split (inconsistent with vertical/horizontal folding seen in top row).  
  - *Option B*: Second image is a vertical half (aligns with top row’s half-folded images), third image is a quarter with shapes in an upper-left quadrant (matches the top row’s quarter-folded alignment).

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the symmetry and structure of the blue hollowed-out shapes in the top row and how they relate to the folding steps in options A–D.  

1. **Symmetry of Blue Shapes**: The top row’s circles have blue shapes (squares/hexagons) arranged symmetrically around the circumference. These shapes correspond to edges that meet during folding, forming faces of the 3D shape.  
2. **Folding Steps Analysis**: Each option shows two folds. The first fold divides the circle into sectors, and the second refines them. The original images’ blue shapes suggest a division into four equal sectors (e.g., the first image has 4 blue squares at cardinal directions, implying a 4 - section fold).  
3. **Matching Options**:  
   - Option D first folds the circle along a diameter (dividing into two semicircles) and then folds again along a perpendicular diameter (dividing into four quarters). This matches the symmetry of the original images’ blue shapes, which align with four - section folding. Other options (A, B, C) do not match the consistent four - section symmetry seen in the top row’s patterns. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>D<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the top row’s patterns (circles with blue hollowed-out shapes) and match them to the folding sequences (A–D). Key observations include the symmetry of blue shapes and how folding transforms them into shaded regions.  

- **Top row patterns**: Blue shapes are evenly distributed (e.g., 4 positions in some, consistent with radial symmetry). Folding must preserve the relative positioning of these shapes as shaded regions.  
- **Evaluate options**:  
  - *A*: Final shaded region is too simple (single large section), inconsistent with multiple blue shapes.  
  - *B*: First fold splits the circle into two equal halves (matching radial division), second fold splits into four, with the upper - left quadrant shaded. This aligns with the top row’s distribution of blue shapes (evenly spaced, leading to a quadrant - based shading).  
  - *C*: Similar to B but shading position differs, less consistent with the top row’s shape alignment.

To determine the best matching folding rule, analyze how the circle transforms through two folds (consistent across all patterns) and matches the position/number of blue hollows.  

- **Folding Logic**: The original circles have blue hollows (squares/circles) in specific positions. The folding rule must map these positions to the final sector after two folds (e.g., first fold along a diameter, second fold along a radius or diagonal, creating sectors).  
- **Option Analysis**:  
  - **A**: Curved edges in both folds don’t align with the original’s angular/hollow positions.  
  - **B**: Semicircle → quarter-fold doesn’t match the original’s varied hollow distributions.  
  - **C**: Diagonal first fold (creates a semicircle split by diagonal) + radius second fold (creates a quarter-sector) matches how the original’s 4-position hollows condense into a sector, preserving positional logic.  
  - **D**: Final shape’s structure doesn’t match the original’s hollow distribution consistency.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the pattern of folding (first fold along a diameter, second fold along a perpendicular diameter) and how the hollowed - out (blue) areas transform. The original patterns show hollowed - out shapes that, when folded twice (once along a vertical/horizontal diameter, then along a perpendicular diameter), align to form the final shape. Among options A, B, C, D, only option A’s sequence of folds (full circle → semicircle → quarter - shaped section) matches the transformation of the hollowed - out areas as seen in the top - row patterns. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the symmetry and folding steps of the top row patterns. The top row’s shapes have symmetrical arrangements around both horizontal and vertical axes, requiring folds along perpendicular diameters (e.g., vertical then horizontal) to create a quarter - sectioned final shape. Among options A - D, **B** shows a first fold dividing the circle into two equal halves (vertical split, half gray, half white), followed by a second fold dividing one half into quarters (horizontal split, one quarter gray). This matches the symmetrical structure and folding logic of the top row patterns. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the pattern of blue hollow shapes (squares/crosses) across the top row and match them to the unfolding sequences in A–D. The key is identifying how the folding/unfolding preserves the position and symmetry of the blue shapes.  

- **Top row analysis**: All circles start with blue shapes in symmetrical positions (e.g., cardinal directions, central crosses). Folding must preserve these symmetries when unfolded.  
- **Option evaluation**:  
  - **A**: Unfolded shape has two gray sectors, inconsistent with multi-position hollows.  
  - **B**: Unfolded shape has one sector, fails symmetry.  
  - **C**: Unfolded shape has overlapping sectors, does not match uniform positioning.  
  - **D**: Unfolded shape’s structure does not align with the top row’s hollow placement.  

However, re-evaluating, the top row likely uses a fold that creates quarter-sections (matching the first image’s four hollows). Among A–D, **A**’s unfolding produces sector divisions that could correspond to the hollows’ symmetry when folded and unfolded. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the best matching folding rule, analyze the relationship between the initial hexagon’s blue shapes (hollowing out) and the final 3D shape across all patterns. Key observations include the symmetry, number of blue shapes, and folding sequence.  

- **Top row analysis**: Hexagons have blue shapes arranged symmetrically; folding must preserve these symmetries in the 3D result.  
- **Option evaluation**:  
  - *A* shows overly simple linear folds (half → quarter), inconsistent with the top row’s complex shape transitions.  
  - *B*’s diagonal fold and resulting shape do not align with the top row’s blue shape distribution (e.g., paired/positioned blue shapes don’t map correctly).  
  - *C*’s folding creates a shape with mismatched blue shape alignment relative to the top row.  
  - *D*’s folding sequence (hexagon → partial hexagon → complex shape) fails to match the top row’s blue shape consistency.  

Re-examining, the correct logic is identifying that only one option’s folding preserves the blue shape positions and symmetry seen in the top row. After re-evaluating, the best match is determined to be <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|> (correcting earlier missteps; upon closer inspection, B’s folding aligns with the top row’s shape transformations and blue shape mapping).

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the pattern of folding and the position of blue (hollowed - out) shapes. The top row’s shapes follow a consistent folding sequence where a hexagon is folded twice, transforming the hollowed - out blue regions into specific orientations. By comparing each option’s folding steps (first to second, then second to third) with the top row’s transformation (original hexagon → folded hexagon → final hexagon with hollows), we find that Option <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|> matches the pattern: the first fold creates a vertical gray section corresponding to the hollowed - out area, and the second fold forms a shape with the hollows aligned vertically, consistent with the top row’s final hexagon.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze how the blue hollowed - out shapes transform through the folding steps in both the top row and the bottom options. The key is identifying a consistent folding pattern (e.g., diagonal fold, corner fold) that maps the initial position of the blue shapes to their final position in the folded structure. By comparing each option’s sequence of folds (first fold → second fold) with the transformation of the blue shapes in the top row, we find that option <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|>’s folding steps match the pattern of how the hollowed - out shapes’ positions change during folding.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the sequence of folds (first and second folds) for each option, ensuring consistency with the top row’s pattern. The top row uses a uniform folding method, so we identify which option’s folding sequence matches.  

- **Option A**: Features a slanted first fold followed by another slanted fold, aligning with the structural transformation seen in the top row’s patterns.  
- **Options B, C, D** either use non - slanted folds (vertical, large diagonal without matching structure) or inconsistent folding sequences.  


Thus, the option that best matches the folding rule is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze how the flat shapes (top row) transform through folding into the 3Dstructures (bottom options A-D), considering the hollowed-out (blue) regions.  

1. **Understand the Transformation**: The top row’s shapes have blue hollows; folding must align these hollows into internal cavities.  
2. **Evaluate Options**:  
   - **A** and **B** use simpler, non-diagonal folds that don’t match the varied positions of hollows in the top row.  
   - **C** uses diagonal folds, which can align the hollows’ positions across different top-row variations (since diagonal folds allow flexible positioning of internal cavities).

To determine the correct folding rule,analyze how the blue hollowed - out shapes translate through folding into the final 3D structure. The blue shapes represent hollowing out, so the folding rule must show these hollowed areas becoming internal cavities in the folded shape.  

- **Option A**: The sequence shows a simple fold but results in a small triangular shape, which doesn’t match the complexity of the hollowed - out patterns in the top row.  
- **Option B**: The sequence includes a fold that splits the house into two sections (gray and white), with the second image having a dotted fold line. After folding, the third image is a square with a gray top section, which aligns with how hollowed - out areas can form distinct internal surfaces.  
- **Option C**: The folding creates a slanted shape, which doesn’t match the expected translation of hollowed - out areas into structured cavities.  
- **Option D**: The fold divides the house vertically, resulting in a tall rectangular shape, which doesn’t match the variety of hollowed - out patterns seen in the top row.

- **Option A**: The folding sequence involves creating large triangular flaps first, then further folding. This matches the transformation of the hollowed - out shapes’ positions and forms when compared to the top row’s patterns.  
- **Option B**: While it has folding steps, the complexity and symmetry of the unfolded shapes do not align with the top row’s varied hollowed - out shapes.  
- **Option C**: Vertical/horizontal folding results in simpler, less varied cut - out shapes, which do not match the top row’s diverse hollowed - out forms.

After rechecking, the correct option is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|> (as it shows a vertical fold, then a cut that mirrors, matching the edge hollows’ symmetry).

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the relationship between the top row’s patterns and the folding options (A–D). The top row’s patterns involve rectangular shapes with blue hollows (edges/corners) that transform through folds into specific cut-out positions. Key observations include:  
- The top images’ blue shapes (edges/corners) must align with the final cut-outs after two folds.  
- Options C use triangular folds (inconsistent with rectangular hollows), eliminating C.  
- Options B and D have non-matching edge alignments for the top images’ symmetrical/hollow patterns.  
- Option <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|> follows a vertical → horizontal folding sequence, which maps the top images’ edge/corner hollows to the final cut-out positions (matching the transformation of rectangular edges to quadrant-based cut-outs).

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the sequence of folds and how the blue hollow shapes align with the final shapes. Each top image uses the same folding rule, so the sequence of folds (first and second) must match across all examples.  

- **Option A**: First fold divides the rectangle into two unequal sections (one larger, one smaller), then folds into a single column. This matches the structural progression seen in the top images’ folding logic (where shapes are reduced through sequential folds).  
- **Option B**: Second fold results in a multi-part shape, inconsistent with the uniformity needed for all top images.  
- **Option C**: Involves triangular folds, which do not match the rectangular hollow structures in the top images.  
- **Option D**: While similar to A, its first fold’s division does not align with the top images’ folding consistency.  


Thus, the best match is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze how the shapes transform through folding, cutting (hollowing out, shown in blue), and unfolding. Each option represents a potential folding sequence, and the goal is to identify which sequence produces the symmetrical, multi-shape patterns seen in the top row.  

- **Option A**: Shows simple rectangular folds without creating the complex, multiple-shape symmetry needed.  
- **Option B**: Unfolds into overlapping triangular shapes that do not match the uniform grouping of shapes in the top row.  
- **Option C**: Features a series of folds that create mirrored triangular sections, which, when unfolded, produce a shape with multiple distinct regions matching the symmetrical arrangement of shapes in the top row.

Each top image is a rectangle with irregular blue shapes; the folding rule must produce a final shape where these shapes’ positions align with the folded sections.

- **Option A**: Uses horizontal folds, resulting in middle sections, which do not match corner hollows.  
- **Option B**: Uses vertical then small folds, resulting in an upper - left section, which does not match.  
- **Option C**: Uses vertical then horizontal folds, creating symmetrical corner sections when unfolded, matching the corner hollows in the top row.  
- **Option D**: Uses diagonal folds, resulting in triangular sections, which do not match.  

Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>C<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze how the blue hollow shapes (in the top row) relate to the folding sequences (A–D). The blue shapes represent cuts that, when folded, create symmetrical hollows. Folding rules must preserve the symmetry and arrangement of these hollows.  

- **Option A**: Creates irregular triangular hollows, not matching the symmetrical patterns of the top row.  
- **Option B**: Forms hollows with angular corners, inconsistent with the rounded/hexagonal shapes in the top row.  
- **Option C**: Results in hollows with uneven spacing, not matching the uniformity of the top row’s designs.

To determine the best matching folding rule, analyze the top row’s patterns (shapes’ positions and folding logic) and compare with options A–D. The top images show shapes (circles, hexagons, squares) positioned in distinct areas (corners, edges) before folding; folding must replicate these positional symmetries.  

- **Option A** involves irregular triangular folds, which don’t align with the structured positioning of shapes seen in the top row.

- **Option D** has overly complex small shapes, inconsistent with the larger, varied shapes in the top row.  

After evaluating positional symmetry and shape consistency, none of the initial assumptions fit perfectly.

To determine the best matching folding rule, analyze the pattern of blue hollow shapes (hollowing out) and how they transform across the top sequence. The key is identifying which folding rule (A, B, C, D) consistently explains the reduction and arrangement of these shapes.  

1. Observe the top sequence: Shapes start with multiple scattered blue forms, then reduce in number and change arrangement. This suggests folding that combines or overlaps regions, reducing visible shapes.  
2. Evaluate each option:  
   - **A**: Shows a square folded into two vertical sections (first arrow), then one section remains (second arrow). This matches the reduction of shapes by halving the area, aligning with the top sequence’s shape simplification.  
   - **B** (diagonal fold): Creates triangular shapes, which do not match the top sequence’s non - triangular arrangement.  
   - **C** (similar to A but with subtle differences): Does not match the specific shape transitions of the top sequence.  
   - **D** (complex triangular folds): Results in intricate layered shapes inconsistent with the top sequence’s simpler reductions.

To determine the best matching folding rule, analyze the consistency of shape transformations and hollowing patterns. The top row’s shapes (various blue figures) must result from a uniform folding + cutting process.  

- **Option A**: Diagonal fold → additional fold → cut. This creates layered triangular regions, which can form multiple distinct shapes when unfolded (matching the varied shapes in the top row).  
- **Option B**: Vertical fold → cut → unfold. Results in simpler rectangular/horizontal shapes, inconsistent with the diverse shapes (circles, hexagons, etc.) in the top row.

To determine the best matching folding rule, analyze the transformation of blue hollowing-out shapes through folding and cutting. Each option (A–D) describes a folding sequence followed by a cut. The key is identifying which folding rule’s final unfolded shape matches the pattern of blue cutouts in the top row. By comparing the structure of cutouts (position, shape, and symmetry) across options, **B**’s vertical folding and subsequent cut produces a central vertical hollowing that aligns with the pattern of distributed cutouts in the top images. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, we analyze the transformation of shapes (folding → cutting) in the top sequence and match it to the options below. The top sequence involves folding a square, then making a cut (hollowing out) that reflects a consistent folding pattern. Among options A–D, option <|begin_of_box|>C<|end_of_box|> demonstrates a folding sequence where the initial fold creates a triangular section, followed by a secondary fold that aligns with the positioning of shapes seen in the top sequence. This matches the "same folding rule" required for all patterns.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the pattern of shape reduction and folding logic. The top sequence shows blue shapes (hollowing out) reducingin number through folding—likely via diagonal or strategic folds that mirror/collapse shapes. Among options A–D, **Option A** demonstrates a diagonal fold followed by an additional fold toward a corner, which aligns with the progressive reduction and grouping of shapes seen in the top sequence.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze how the blue shapes (cutouts) transform across the top sequence and match with options A–D. The top images show blue shapes transitioning from scattered positions to grouped configurations, implying a folding rule that divides the square into sections (columns/rows) and collapses them.  

- **Option A** involves triangular folds, which do not match the rectangular grouping seen in the top images.  
- **Option B** first folds the square into two vertical columns (dividing the shape into sections), then collapses to one column. This matches the grouping of shapes into fewer sections observed in the top images.  
- **Option C** uses horizontal folds, which do not align with the rectangular grouping shown.  
- **Option D** has inconsistent sectioning compared to the top images’ grouping.  


Thus, the best match is <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|>.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original circular patterns (top row) and the folding rules (bottom options A–D). Key observations include identifying how blue “hollowed - out” shapes transform under folding, focusing on symmetry and shaded regions.  

- **Top row analysis**: Each circle contains blue shapes (hollowing out); folding must map these to a consistent shaded pattern. For example, circles with blue shapes on opposite sides (e.g., the second image) suggest a vertical or horizontal fold dividing the circle into two equal halves.  
- **Folding rule evaluation**:  
  - **Option A**: Diagonal fold creates a quarter - shaped shaded region, inconsistent with the symmetric patterns.  
  - **Option B**: Vertical fold divides the circle into two equal semicircles, with the shaded region matching the expected transformation of hollowed - out shapes.  
  - **Option C**: Three - section fold does not align with the simple symmetric patterns seen.  
  - **Option D**: Irregular curved fold lacks consistency with the uniform folding seen in the top row.  


Thus, the best - matching folding rule is Option <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|>.

To solve this folding puzzle, we analyze how the blue hollow shapes (unshaded regions) relate to the shaded regions after folding, using the principle that the area covered by hollows becomes shaded upon folding.  

1. Observe the original patterns: Each circle contains blue hollow shapes, and the goal is to identify which folding rule (A–D) results in a shaded region matching the expected coverage of these hollows.  
2. Evaluate each option:  
   - **Option A**: Shows a quarter-shaded region, which does not match the full-half or symmetric shading needed for the hollows’ coverage.  
   - **Option B**: Displays a vertically divided circle with one half shaded. This aligns with the idea that hollows on one half of the circle, when folded over, shade the opposite half, matching the symmetry of typical folding rules for such puzzles.  
   - **Option C**: Has small arc-shaped shaded regions, inconsistent with the uniform coverage of hollows.  
   - **Option D**: Features a half-shaded region with an irregular shape, not matching the expected symmetry.  


Thus, the folding rule that best matches the patterns is <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|>.

1. **Understand the Pattern**: Blue shapes represent “hollowing out” areas; the folding rule must map these positions to the corresponding shaded regions in the folded shape.  
2. **Evaluate Options**:  
   - **A** shows a circle folded into a shape with four triangular cutouts (matching a cross-fold with two perpendicular diameters, aligning with multiple blue shapes’ positions).  
   - **B** (half-gray/half-white) implies a single-axis fold, inconsistent with multiple blue shapes.  
   - **C** (semicircular cutout) suggests an asymmetric fold, not matching the symmetric blue shapes.  
   - **D** (rounded cutouts) lacks the angular alignment needed for multiple distinct blue shapes.  
3. **Consistency Check**: All top-row images have multiple blue shapes distributed across the circle. A cross-fold (two perpendicular diameters) creates four sectors, matching the four triangular cutouts in option A. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the relationship between the original circles with blue hollow shapes and the folded results. The blue shapes represent hollowing out, and the folding rule must create a symmetrical pattern matching the arrangement of these hollows.  

- **Option A** shows a circle folded into a shape with four large, angular hollows arranged symmetrically (forming a diamond - shaped pattern). This matches the expectation of blue shapes (originally at distinct positions around the circle) converging into a symmetrical hollow pattern upon folding.  
- **Options B, C, D** fail to match: B has rounded hollows inconsistent with sharp polygonal cuts, C splits the circle into two halves (not matching multiple hollows), and D has only a small hollow (inconsistent with multiple blue shapes).  

Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze how the blue hollowed - out shapes in the original circles relate to the shaded regions in the folded versions. Each original circle has multiple blue shapes (representing hollowing out), and the folding rule must create a symmetrical shaded region that corresponds to the arrangement of these hollows.

- **Option A** shows a horizontal/vertical half - split, which doesn’t match the multi - shaped hollows in the original patterns.
- **Option B** has an asymmetrical small shaded section, inconsistent with the multiple hollows’ arrangement.
- **Option C** results in a symmetrical four - pointed shaded region, which can correspond to the multiple blue shapes distributed across different quadrants in the original circles.
- **Option D** shows a diagonal half - split, which also doesn’t match the non - diagonal distribution of hollows.


Thus, the option that best matches the folding rule is <|begin_of_box|>C<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the pattern of shapes and symmetry. The top row shows circles with multiple blue hollowed - out shapes (squares, hexagons, etc.). When folding, the hollowed - out shapes’ positions should form a symmetrical pattern based on the fold’s symmetry. Among options A, B, C, D:
- **A** shows 2 - fold symmetry (semicircle), not matching the multi - shaped complexity.
- **B** and **C** show non - square symmetries, while the top images suggest 4 - fold symmetry (matching a diamond/diamond - like shape).
- **D** shows a 4 - fold symmetrical shape (diamond within the circle), which aligns with the arrangement of multiple hollowed - out shapes when folded into quadrants.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original circles’ blue hollow shapes and the folded results. The blue shapes represent hollowed - out sections, so when folded, these hollows determine the shaded (non - hollow) regions in the folded shape.

We examine each folding option:
- **Option A**: Shows a full circle folding into a semicircle with the right half shaded. This suggests a vertical fold along a diameter, where the right - hand side’s features (including blue hollows) map to the shaded semicircle.
- **Option B**: Has curved edges from the hollows but lacks a clear shaded pattern matching the hollow distribution.
- **Option C**: Uses a diagonal fold, creating a quarter - shaped shaded area, which doesn’t align with the circular hollow distribution seen.
- **Option D**: Also shows a semicircle, but its shaded area orientation and hollow mapping don’t match the top - row patterns.

The top - row circles have blue hollows distributed across quadrants. Folding along a vertical diameter (as in Option A) correctly maps these hollows to the shaded semicircle, matching the transformation logic of the hollows becoming part of the shaded region after folding. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original circle with blue hollow shapes and the folded result, ensuring the folding rule applies consistently. The blue shapes represent hollowed - out areas, so the folded shape’s shaded regions should correspond to these hollows’ symmetrical placement.

- The top - row images show circles with varying numbers of blue shapes; the folding rule must create a result where the hollowed areas’ symmetry matches the given options.
- Among options A, B, C, D, **option D** best fits because its diagonal fold creates a shaded region that aligns with the expected symmetrical coverage of hollow shapes when folded, matching the overall pattern logic. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>D<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze the relationship between the blue hollowed shapes (before folding) and the resulting shaded areas (after folding) across all top images. Each top image’s blue shapes represent hollowed-out regions, and the folding rule must produce a consistent shaded pattern.

- **Option A**: Shows a crescent - shaped shaded area, which does not match the expected symmetry or shape derived from typical hollow - to - shaded transformations of the given blue shapes.
- **Option B**: Has small arc - like shaded areas, which do not align with the scale or distribution of the blue shapes in the top images.

To solve this folding puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original hexagons with blue hollow shapes and the folding results. The blue shapes represent hollowing out, and the folding rule must consistently map the position of these hollows to the final shape.

- **Option A**: Shows a hexagon folding into a shape with triangular hollows at the top. This matches the idea of a corner hollow (seen in some top - hexagons) becoming a triangular cutout when folded, consistent with the pattern of small, localized hollows.
- **Options B, C, D** show larger, non - triangular or non - corner - based hollows, which do not align with the small, varied hollow positions seen in the top - row hexagons.


Thus, the option that best matches the folding rule is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To solve this folding puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original hexagons with blue hollows (hollowing out) and the folded versions, ensuring the same folding rule applies across all top-row patterns.1. **Identify Pattern Consistency**: The top row’s hexagons have blue hollows in various positions. The folding rule must map these hollows’ positions to the folded shape consistently.
2. **Evaluate Folding Options (A–D)**:
   - **Option A** shows a large triangular hollow, which does not match the scattered small hollows in the top-row hexagons.

1. The blue shapes in the top row are small and located in different positions (corners), representing “hollowing out” areas.
2. We need a folding rule that transforms the initial hexagons into a final shape whose internal structure corresponds to the combined effect of the small blue shapes.
3. Analyzing each option:

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the sequence of images and folding options. The top row shows a progression where multiple blue hollows (hollowing out) reduce in number and reposition, indicating a folding rule that combines these hollows. We evaluate each folding option (A–D) based on how it transforms the initial house - shaped paper with hollows into the final configuration.

- **Option A** splits the paper horizontally without combining hollows, so it’s incorrect.
- **Option B** creates triangular hollows, which don’t match the progression of reducing hollows to one.
- **Option C** has a large diagonal hollow, but the sequence suggests a more focused repositioning.
- **Option D**’s folded shape combines the hollows into a large, repositioned area consistent with the sequence’s reduction and repositioning of hollows. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>D<|end_of_box|>.

To determine the correct folding rule, analyze how the shapes transform under folding, focusing on the consistency of the folding action across the top row’s patterns. Each option (A–D) represents a potential folding method, and we need to identify which one matches the transformation of the house - shaped figures with blue hollowed - out shapes.

- **Option A**: Shows a simple fold where the top corners are folded downward, creating small triangular flaps. This fold maintains the general pentagonal structure of the house and aligns with how the hollowed - out shapes could appear when folded, as the transformation is consistent with the changes seen in the top row’s house shapes.
- **Option B** creates an overly fragmented shape with many triangular sections, which doesn’t match the simplicity of the top row’s transformations.
- **Option C** has a large diagonal fold that results in an irregular shape, inconsistent with the top row’s house - like forms.
- **Option D** also features a large fold but with a different angle, leading to a less consistent transformation.


Thus, the folding rule that best matches the patterns above is <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original shapes (with blue hollowing - out shapes) and the folded versions, ensuring consistency with a single folding rule across all patterns. The key is identifying how the blue shapes’ positions transform during folding.

1. Observe the top row’s original shapes: Blue shapes are primarily located on the upper portion (near the “roof” of the house - shaped figure).
2. Consider the folding action: The most logical fold is along the top edge (roof edge), bringing the roof portion down over the base. This transforms the upper area with blue shapes into a distinct region on the folded figure.
3. Evaluate options A–D:
   - **Option A** shows a large triangular gray area in the folded figure, which matches the expected transformation of the upper - positioned blue shapes into a coherent geometric region after folding. Other options (B, C, D) either show inconsistent divisions (horizontal, multiple small triangles, diagonal) or do not align with the uniformity required by the “same folding rule.”

1. Examine the initial shapes (top row) and their potential folded forms. The shapes involve simple folds rather than complex star patterns (eliminating B).
2. Compare remaining options (A, C, D). Options B and D show overly complex/far-reaching folds inconsistent with the initial shapes’ simplicity. Between A and C, observe the fold’s position and resulting hollow placement. The initial hollows are near the top corners; a small corner fold (as in A/C) aligns better.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the shapes in the top row (showing various blue hollowed - out shapes) and the folding options below. The key is identifying which folding rule creates a shape that, when unfolded, matches the pattern of hollowed - out shapes across the sequence.

- **Option A** shows a rectanglefolded into a single large triangle. This would produce only one large hollowed - out shape when unfolded, which doesn’t match the multiple small shapes seen in the top row.
- **Option B** shows a rectangle folded into two rectangular halves. Unfolding this would give two rectangular hollows, which also doesn’t match the varied shapes in the top row.
- **Option C** shows a rectangle folded into multiple triangular sections. When unfolded, these sections would correspond to multiple distinct hollowed - out shapes, matching the variety of small blue shapes in the top row’s sequence.
- **Option D** shows a rectangle folded into two triangular flaps at the bottom. Unfolding this would give two triangular hollows, which again doesn’t match the multiple small shapes.


Thus, the folding rule that best matches the patterns above is <|begin_of_box|>C<|end_of_box|>.

For the top patterns, the shapes’ symmetry and positioning suggest a folding method that creates a cross - like or quadrant - based structure when unfolded. Among the options, **Option B** shows a folded square with a cross - shaped cut that, when unfolded, results in a symmetrical pattern with triangular cut - outs matching the complexity and symmetry of the top patterns. Other options (A, C, D) either create simpler geometric divisions (rectangles, single triangles) that don’t align with the varied shapes in the top images. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>B<|end_of_box|>.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the folding rule’s consistency across the top row’s patterns and match it to the options below. Each top image has blue cutouts (hollowing out), and the folding rule must transform them into a shape with symmetry matching the original arrangements.

- **Option A** (diagonal fold) creates a single triangular shape, which doesn’t account for multiple cutouts’ positions.
- **Option B** (vertical fold) produces rectangular sections, inconsistent with varied cutout orientations.
- **Option C** (diamond fold) forms a symmetrical diamond, but its structure doesn’t align with the mixed cutout types.
- **Option D** (cross-fold, creating four triangular flaps and a central area) matches the logic: multiple cutouts on the original square become distinct sections in the folded shape, reflecting the original’s varied positions through symmetrical folding.

Thus, the best match is <|begin_of_box|>D<|end_of_box|>.

- **Option A**: Shows a horizontal fold with half gray and half white. This doesn’t match the complex arrangement of cutouts in the top images.
- **Option B**: Shows a square folded into four triangular sections (with two darker and two lighter shades), which can result from folding along both diagonals. This symmetry matches how cutout shapes would mirror and combine under such a fold.

To solve the paper fold puzzle, we analyze the relationship between the original shapes (with blue hollows) and the folded results, identifying the consistent folding rule.

1. **Understand the Folding Rule**: Blue shapes represent hollows; when the paper is folded, these hollows’ positions transform according to the fold’s axis.
2. **Analyze Options**:
   - **A** shows a square folded into a “house” shape—this does not match the simple geometric transformation seen.
   - **B** shows a square folded into a half-triangle (hypotenuse on the left)—the hollow positions don’t align with this orientation.
   - **C** shows a square folded into a right triangle with the hypotenuse on the right (matching a fold along the main diagonal, from top - left to bottom - right). This aligns with how hollows in quadrants of the original square map to the folded triangle’s regions.
   - **D** shows a square folded into horizontal strips—an incorrect transformation for the hollow patterns.
3. **Confirm Pattern Match**: The original images’ hollows’ spatial relationships (quadrant positions) correspond to the right - angled triangle in option C, where folding along the main diagonal maps quadrants to the triangle’s sections. Thus, the answer is <|begin_of_box|>C<|end_of_box|>.

To solve this folding puzzle, we analyze the transformation of blue hollow shapes across the sequence and match it to the folding rules in A–D. The key is identifying how the initial arrangement of blue shapes maps to the folded result under a consistent folding rule.

1. Observe the first four images: blue shapes (squares, circles) are positioned in non-overlapping areas of a square. When folded, these shapes must align symmetrically.
2. Evaluate folding options:
   - **A** and **C** show triangular halves, which don’t account for multiple symmetric positions of hollow shapes.
   - **D** shows vertical divisions, which don’t match the scattered hollow shapes’ alignment.
   - **B** shows a diamond-shaped division into four triangular sections, matching the symmetry needed when folding a square along both diagonals (a common rule for creating symmetric folded patterns with multiple hollow regions).

To solve this, we analyze the folding rule by examining how the shapes transform. The top row shows a sequence starting with an empty square (unfolded state) followed by squares/hexagons in various positions (after folding). We test each option:
- **Option A**: Folds along a diagonal, transforming the square into a triangle. Shapes in the original square’s corners align with the triangle’s sections (e.g., a shape near the top - left moves to the bottom - right of the triangle).
- **Option B**: Folds along two adjacent sides, creating a smaller square with a triangular cut - out. This doesn’t match the corner alignment of shapes.
- **Option C**: Folds horizontally/vertically, resulting in a rectangular band structure, which doesn’t match the angular shapes.
- **Option D**: Folds along both diagonals, forming a diamond. While symmetrical, it doesn’t match the corner - aligned shapes.
